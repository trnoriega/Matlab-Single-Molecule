Matlab-Single-Molecule
======================

Scripts to analyze single molecule fluorescence experiments. Derived from work done in Joseph D. Puglisi's lab at Stanford University and Peter Walter's lab at the University of California San Francisco. 

-fretSelector function selects cleans up large datasets by selecting traces that show temporal anti-correlation between donor and acceptor fluorophore channels, and are therefore likely to have fluorescence resonace energy transfer (FRET) signal. 

-stateAssign function allows user to make state assignments for single molecule fluorescent observations over multiple color channels and multiple assignment classes. A screencast is available at: http://youtu.be/qF3qw5ELV90

-simulator script is an example of a stochastic simulation algorithm that will simulate signal recognition-ribosome binding experiments under single molecule experiments.
